# Python Hockey Analytics (2020-2021) (2021-2022)
This analysis is based on Patrick Bacon's Python Hockey Analytics Tutorial (https://towardsdatascience.com/python-hockey-analytics-tutorial-b0883085938a#81ab), however I've modified the data to scrape data (courtesy of @TopDownHockey) from the 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 NHL seasons.
